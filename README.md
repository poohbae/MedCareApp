# MedCare App — Secure Doctor Appointment Slot Booking System

### Overview

The **MedCare App** is a web-based doctor appointment slot booking system built with **Flask**, designed to allow patients to conveniently schedule appointments with doctors through a secure online platform.
It was developed as an enhanced version of an existing open-source system, focusing on **improving functionality, usability, and security**.

This version implements comprehensive **security mechanisms** including:

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
* Input validation and sanitization
* Data encryption and password hashing
* HTTPS with TLS 1.3
* Logging and analytics dashboard
* Automated vulnerability and dependency scanning

### Installation Guide

#### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/poohbae/MedCareApp.git
cd MedCareApp

#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # For Windows

#### 3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 4. Generate SSL certificates for HTTPS (optional for local testing)

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

#### 5. Run the application

python app.py
Then open: [https://127.0.0.1:5000](https://127.0.0.1:5000)
